## 🟩 Phase 2 – Code Forensics (Swap, Decrypt, Grade)

(After the teacher collects and redistributes the handwritten solutions)

You are now a **Code Investigation Team**.

You will receive another group’s handwritten code.

---

## 🔍 Part A – Decrypt the Original Question (~15 minutes)

Without being told the real problem:

1. Read the code carefully  
2. Infer what the original question must have been  
3. Write one clear sentence:

> “We believe the original question was asking to ________.”

Precision matters.

---

## 📊 Part B – Grade Like a Teacher (15 minutes)

Evaluate:

✔ Correct logic  
✔ Completeness  
✔ Edge cases  
✔ Code clarity  
✔ Variable naming  
✔ Structure

Give:

- A numeric grade  
- Two strengths  
- One improvement suggestion

Professional feedback only.

---

## 🗣 Part C – Reveal & Discuss (Whole Class)

The original group:

- Reads the real question  
- Compares it with the reconstructed one  
- Responds to the grade

Class discussion focuses on:

- Accuracy of decryption  
- Code clarity  
- Common misunderstandings

---

## 🎯 Learning Goals

Students practice:

- Understanding unfamiliar code  
- Reverse engineering logic  
- Writing readable solutions  
- Giving professional feedback  
- Debugging by reasoning

These are real-world programming skills.
