## 🟦 Phase 1 – Solve the Mystery Question (Handwritten)

<!-- ### ⏱ Lesson Initialization – 5 minutes -->

Before receiving any questions, each group must organize itself.

## Each group chooses

### ✍️ Code Writer  

- Writes the **entire solution by hand**  
- Must have **clear, tidy handwriting**  
- No scribbles, no mess, no arrows everywhere  
- Add Comments. Consider someone else will have to understand the code.
- Add Comments. Consider someone else will have to understand the code.

---

### 🌍 Translator (Hebrew ⟶ English)  

- Translates the question for the group  
- Makes sure everyone understands the exact meaning  
- Clarifies technical terms before coding begins

---

### 👥 All other members (feel free to designate specific roles or just mix it all)

- Think through the algorithm  
- Suggest improvements  
- Check logic  
- Catch mistakes

No one else writes the final solution.

---

## 📄 Task Rules

Each group will receive:

- One unique programming question  
- Written in Hebrew

Your job:

✅ Understand it fully (with the translator)  
✅ Design the algorithm together  
✅ **Handwrite** a clean, complete solution  
✅ Add short comments if useful

Write as if this is going to be professionally reviewed.

No communication between groups.

### ⏱ Writing Time – 15 minutes

Use the full time wisely.  
Quality and clarity matter.
